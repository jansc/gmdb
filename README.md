## Gopher Movie Database

The Goper Music Database is a quick hack exposing movie data
from IMDb via the gopher protocol and making it available to 
gopher clients on port 70.

The service is available live at
[gopher://jan.bio/1/cgi-bin/gmdb.py](gopher://jan.bio/1/cgi-bin/gmdb.py).

## Help wanted

Improvements are very much welcome! One idea is to have actor pages
that list movies an actor plays in, including some facts about the actor.
